# Nubomedia Graph Editor - Visual Tool

This project is part of NUBOMEDIA. Find out more at [http://www.nubomedia.eu](http://www.nubomedia.eu).

NUBOMEDIA is the first cloud platform specifically designed for hosting interactive multimedia services. NUBOMEDIA exposes to developers PaaS APIs for creating media pipelines. A media pipeline is a chain of elements providing media capabilities such as encryption, transcoding, augmented reality or video content analysis. These chains allow building arbitrarily complex media processing for applications. As a unique feature, from the point of view of the pipelines, the NUBOMEDIA cloud infrastructure behaves as a single virtual super-computer encompassing all the available resources of the physical network.
