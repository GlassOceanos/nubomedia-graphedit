# Software Architecture

This tool is composed of two different applications:

- The Graph Editor is a desktop app that lets a developer visually create and edit component graphs and save them as json-based files with the `.ngeprj` file extension.

- The Code Generator is a command-line app that takes `.ngeprj` files and generates source code to implement these graphs in new applications.
